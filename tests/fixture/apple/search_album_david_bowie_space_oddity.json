          "editorialNotes": {
            "short": "“I did my best to make it better. I think David would approve.”",
            "standard": "Tony Visconti always listens to <i>Space Oddity</i>, the first album he produced for David Bowie, with trepidation. “I hear things,” he tells Apple Music. “Things that if I could’ve done them better, I would have done them better. The music is great, but the mixing was really bad. I was a novice—a decent musician, but not very good at running production.” That’s why remixing the album for its 50th anniversary was something of a catharsis. He sweated over the process in his New York studio, where a framed drawing of Bowie hangs over the spot where rock’s great chameleon would sit while the pair worked on his final albums, <i>The Next Day</i> and <i>Blackstar</i>. “I have this second chance to do something right about that album, and I’m terrified that I might do something wrong,” Visconti says. “So, during the mixes, I turned to that space quite a bit and I said, ‘Well, what do you think, David?’ Not that he answered me, but I just feel like he’s never really left us.” The duo’s bond was strong enough that Visconti can feel confident Bowie would approve of the job he’s done here. He’s excavated what he calls “hidden treasures”—notes, sounds, vocals—that had been buried in the original mix, and created a brighter, bolder <i>Space Oddity</i>. Here, he guides us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>Space Oddity (2019 Mix)</b>\n“[In 1969] I couldn't see the wood for the trees. We had just had all these orbits around the Earth, something that was in the news every day. All I saw was David cashing in on that. I called it a cheap shot. Right to his face. We were brutally honest with each other. That's what made us good friends. The job that Gus Dudgeon [the engineer who stepped in to produce the track] did was fantastic. I tried to bow out after that. I said to David, ‘I suppose you’re going to stay with Gus.’ And he said, ‘No, I've got that out of the way. Now I can make the album that I want to make.’ I think I’ve made it sparkle and explode a bit more. I think the mix actually makes your body move. Like, you don't realize that the drummer and the bass player were really grooving—the kick drum was always buried in the original mix.”<br />\n<b>Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed (2019 Mix)</b>\n“[David] was in a good space when he wrote this. He wasn't afraid to be politically incorrect. And he would really go for the jugular. [On 1967’s <i>David Bowie</i>], he wanted to be in show business. He was thinking about himself at 40 or 50 years old—king of the musical theater. He told me that. I asked him, in recent years, ‘What would you have done if you weren't a rock star?’ He goes, ‘Oh, I’d do music hall. I'd be writing musicals.’ But on this album, he was speaking for his generation. He was 22 years old, and he was feeling it like the rest of us were feeling it. This was the first song we recorded for the album and it was quite messy, really loosey-goosey playing. I don't mind that, but it made the original mix harder to do because the levels were jumping and there are a few blatant errors. So I tightened up the arrangement and was able to control the dynamics a bit more. There's some brass at the end that was never really poking out much in the original mix but is there now. Everything that is here was [originally] intended to be present.”<br />\n<b>Letter to Hermione (2019 Mix)</b>\n“I just wanted to make it a bit more floaty, a bit more dreamy. It's a beautiful, beautiful song. She [Bowie’s former girlfriend Hermione Farthingale] is very proud of that song. He was crushed when they split up. I've never seen him be so crushed, with any other split-up or any other woman. Hermione was a big thing in his life. She actually helped him a lot, to have a little more self-esteem. And she was a good cheerleader for him.”<br />\n<b>Cygnet Committee (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This is almost 10 minutes long, and the other challenge [with remixing it] is, there aren't many instruments on it. It doesn't have brass or anything. It was an anthem of youth, of the time—about oppression and all kinds of obstacles, and not wanting to make the mistakes of your elders. Trying to build a better future. But it’s kind of a bleak message, put across in a bleak way. And he really cracked up at the end. If my memory serves me well, he burst into tears after he sang that whole ending.”<br />\n<b>Janine (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This was a lot of fun to play, both in the studio and to play live. And I don't actually know who Janine is. You always have somebody in mind when you write a song. [Bowie once suggested it was someone his friend George Underwood was seeing at the time]. Yeah, there was a girl, yeah. I can't remember her name. Janine? I don't think so!”<br />\n<b>An Occasional Dream (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This is so beautiful. It's the epitome of his folk rock. A gentle, gentle song with a nice pokey little rhythm section behind it. Tim Renwick and I played the recorders. The recorder makes an appearance on almost every David Bowie album I produced—so it was a beginning of a thing between us. It was an eight-track recording, and we used to bounce things together because we knew we were going to run out of tracks. Both his lead vocals are on the same track, so it was almost impossible to do anything about that. But I was able to make a distinction between the two voices. I couldn't alter that track very much, but I made it sound pokier and more immediate.”<br />\n<b>Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud (2019 Mix)</b>\n“We only got one take, but we had the blessing of a three-hour rehearsal. David was the rhythm section. He sat right in the middle of the orchestra, with his 12-string, keeping the time. There's a little bleed of his 12-string, even though we had baffles around him to keep the sound out. He was <i>shaking</i> like a leaf at the beginning of the session. By the time the three hours was up, he was very calm about it, and it was a great take. I think Nigel Reeve of EMI told me David said this was his favorite song on the album. I can see why—it’s a masterful performance from him. I don't play piano, so I was writing all [the orchestra’s] parts, from my classical guitar—five sleepless days, just writing. The main thing to do was to get David's vocal in a better place. Get a nicer reverb on his voice. And get a little more depth out of the orchestra.”<br />\n<b>Conversation Piece (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This was really hard to leave off [the original vinyl]. That was a tragedy. We had three very long tracks—‘Cygnet Committee’ ate up the space of three songs—and on vinyl, you only had 20 minutes before you hit the out groove. If you went over the 20-minute mark, you would get one dB lower, for every minute over. This is a very, very sad song. Only years later, I realized that the person in the song who tells the story jumped off a bridge and drowned. That made me make a more sad mix. I was in a space like, ‘This has got to come off with a lot of gravity in the mix,’ even though it's kind of bouncy. There’s a way of mixing a bouncy song a little sadder. Not make it so bright. It’s one of my favorite, favorite songs. I loved playing it live.”<br />\n<b>God Knows I'm Good (2019 Mix)</b>\n“I made it sound a little more roomier. Like it’s in a bright large room, and with David's voice being intimate, but the guitars sound really crisp. Keith Christmas was the other lead guitarist. He played great, so he's featured more on this. It's one of my favorite tracks. The story [about an elderly woman caught shoplifting] is so sad. Oh my god. That's a real weeper, for me. It must have just touched a nerve with him, to even write it in the first place. He must have actually witnessed that.”<br />\n<b>Memory of a Free Festival (2019 Mix)</b>\n“We did this on the same day as ‘Cygnet Committee.’ The bass player was playing for so long, and so hard, his bridge kind of collapsed and almost every note was clicking and buzzing. So that was a job, to get that to sound decent on the remix. David's intro is still as beautiful as ever, with just him on the harmonium. He's underrated as a harmonium player. It's a live recording and he didn't make one mistake. When we did the backing vocals, I invited Marc Bolan to sing the ‘sun machine’ part. He's in there somewhere. You can hear him if you listen closely…I mean, really closely. We had everyone we knew, all our gang from the Three Tuns [pub] in Beckenham. Girlfriends, boyfriends, friends of friends, maybe 40 people in the studio. A few months later, we did it all over again when we did the single version. I really liked the single version a lot better—because by then, I knew what I was doing.”"

            "short": "The equally kaleidoscopic soundtrack—and a study of Bowie’s contrasts.",
            "standard": "Director Brett Morgen’s film about David Bowie, <i>Moonage Daydream</i>, is hardly a straight-ahead artist documentary or biopic, instead collaging together a career story (of sorts) with Bowie as its narrator (of sorts). With the cooperation of Bowie’s estate (the singer died in 2016, two days after releasing his final album, <i>Blackstar</i>), Morgen was given access to his vast archives, and the film presents a fair bit of unearthed audio and video for the first time. \n\nLike the movie, the soundtrack is also kaleidoscopic in its approach: It opens and closes with spoken-word passages that exemplify two of Bowie's many sides—the questing philosopher and the lighthearted, jovial entertainer. In between those bookends are 41 songs (more if you tally up the multi-song medleys) that span Bowie’s catalog. But rather than run down his greatest hits, the soundtrack examines the artist’s wide-ranging creative breadth, with many inclusions given their own exclusive mixes or edits for the film. That opening segment doesn’t just cut to track two; it’s woven into “Ian Fish U.K. Heir,” an ambient track from 1993’s soundtrack for the miniseries <i>The Buddha of Suburbia</i>, which then segues into the Pet Shop Boys-featuring remix of “Hallo Spaceboy,” from 1995’s <i>Outside</i>. In other words, the focus here isn’t “Let’s Dance”—though that does appear in its live form, as do a number of other literal crowd-pleasers. \n\nWhat you don’t hear while wandering the aisles at Trader Joe's are things like Bowie's boundary-pushing excursions with Brian Eno, such as “Moss Garden” or a live version of “Warszawa”—which opens side two of 1977’s <i>Low</i>, Bowie’s most experimental recording at the time—or an alternate version of “The Mysteries” that’s been mixed with lyrics from “Absolute Beginners.” It’s these sorts of pieces that do so much: They offer a contrasting look at one of the 20th and 21st century's most successful pop singers, lending themselves perfectly to a nonlinear film narrative while also highlighting the poetic searching that made Bowie such a revelatory and revolutionary artist."

            "short": "“This album was the beginning of an idea that David didn’t stop exploring.”",
            "standard": "The first thing that comes to mind when Tony Visconti thinks back to the making of <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i>—his second collaboration with David Bowie—is the band and their partners and wives crammed together in a flat at Haddon Hall, a Victorian mansion in South London. “There were seven of us and only two bedrooms,” the producer, who also played bass on the record, tells Apple Music. “People were sleeping all over the place: on floors or upstairs in this little gallery. We had a rehearsal space in the wine cellar, and that’s where we put the drum kit and the amps.” The result—despite Bowie’s third album being a commercial disappointment upon its release in 1970—has come to be regarded as the start of a classic phase for the king of reinvention. Featuring the first appearances of guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer Woody Woodmansey in his band, <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i> mixed hard-rock grooves with a theatrical swagger—and set a blueprint that Bowie would hone as the decade progressed. “We now know it was the beginning of an idea that David didn’t stop exploring,” says Visconti. “I think this album gave birth to <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>. That was the sound that we were getting on <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i>. We were almost there. The seed was planted in all of our minds to go in that direction.”<br />\nTo commemorate its 50th anniversary, Bowie’s third album is here reissued under its original intended title, <i>Metrobolist</i>, with a new mix by Visconti. Revisiting the album’s nine tracks gave the producer the opportunity to push sonic boundaries further than the group’s finances allowed in 1970. “The whole object of remixing an album that old is to use new technology and make it sound fantastic, with tools that we didn’t have in the old days,” he says. “But I can’t forget the ethics we had in the old days around how things should sound.” The only song that remains untouched on the new mix is the atmospheric ballad “After All,” both because Visconti believed it couldn’t be improved and because he couldn’t locate the original tapes. “David has a vault somewhere and nobody can find it,” he teases. “He must have hundreds and hundreds of multi-tracks.\" Here, Visconti talks us through reworking <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i>, one song at a time.<br />\n<b>The Width of a Circle</b>\n“This was probably the only song in our repertoire that we had experienced playing in front of an audience. It felt like an opener. There are three distinct parts of this song. We were playing the front part live, then the middle part where it has that interlude was part of a jam. We were never satisfied with the way this song originally ended, so I remember we said, ‘Let's do a part two.’ Which is that little ethereal part in the middle, and then it goes into that boogie thing for the whole third part. That was invented on the spot. We jammed that for about an hour or two, and when we finished, we said, ‘Oh my god, this is the way it's supposed to be. This is the way we should have played it on stage.’”<br />\n<b>All the Madmen</b>\n“I'd say half the album was rehearsed and the other half was created on the spot. ‘All the Madmen’ was created on the spot in the studio. After David put down the 12-string guitar and a rudimentary vocal, Woody, Mick, and I overdubbed our parts. That's the way The Beatles were doing it at the time. It turned out to be really, really successful. It’s got a lot of texture in it—more than in ‘The Width of a Circle’—and it really sounds like a grand production. As a band, we were all on the same level and there was certainly a musical chemistry.”<br />\n<b>Black Country Rock</b>\n“‘Black Country Rock’ was a jam. We didn't have enough material to record and we had to go in and make an album. We started jamming on those chords, and then I played some funky stuff on the bass and Woody got funky. We put the whole track down and David and the four of us looked at each other: 'What is it? What did we just create?' And because it was funky, somebody said, ‘It’s kind of Black.’ And they said, ‘Yeah, but it's country.’ Then ‘But it's rock.’ And David got out his notepad and I swear he wrote the lyrics on the spot.”<br />\n<b>After All</b>\n“This was another song that was done à la carte. Again, David did his acoustic guitar and vocal and then we just had to figure out what was going to go on it afterwards. It took a bit of time. It was recorded in a whole day, which was a luxury for one song, because in those days you usually did two or three songs in a session. It was piecemeal. There were recorders on it and I played three basses. Slowly, the song built up, and we loved it in the end. And again, David struggled to write the lyrics. He had a ‘la, la, la’ lyric for about a day or two before he finally went in and did the proper lyrics.”<br />\n<b>Running Gun Blues</b>\n“David wrote this on his 12-string and we recorded it live as a band. And it was a good idea of his: a war protest song about Vietnam, I think. I could be totally wrong, but that's what I got from it. It was recorded very, very swiftly. We were good musicians, and I think we got that whole thing down within a few hours: vocals, all the overdubs and the Moog synthesizer. It was probably one of the ones we’d rehearsed in the wine cellar at Beckenham, so we knew the song.”<br />\n<b>Saviour Machine</b>\n“This started out as an earlier song called ‘Ching-a-Ling’ when David was in a group with his former girlfriend Hermione Farthingale. They had this folky song and the middle part of that is the basis of 'Saviour Machine.' It’s a far cry from ‘Ching-a-Ling' to 'Saviour Machine,' which is a very, very heavy subject matter. The nice thing about this song is that I was a young jazz musician from New York and I introduced a jazz bolero beat in there. Woody and Mick looked at each other, having only heard of Ravel's ‘Boléro.’ But I said, ‘No, there's a funky way of playing a bolero in all that.’ And we jammed on that. Woody and Mick were so fast to pick it up. I'm really proud of how this song evolved. I consider it a masterpiece. It's a really great track.”<br />\n<b>She Shook Me Cold</b>\n“Mick said, ‘If I’m going to be in a band with you, you’ve got to play like Jack Bruce.’ So he sat me down and he gave me an education in Jack Bruce's style. I was like any other bass player in those days—I could play funky, I could play rock and all that, but what Jack Bruce did was play lead bass. He played the bass like it was a cello with fingers flying all over the place. So I said, ‘Okay, I got it.’ Besides the heavy chords on the beginning and the end, ‘She Shook Me Cold’ was just a crazy jam. I’ll tell you now, we didn't do that live. We had to do that part separately. But god, it was fun to do and to be so free and liberal. Nowadays, you have to play very simply and carefully, but we could play with wild abandon back in those days. And that's an example of how far out we got permission to be in those days.”<br />\n<b>The Man Who Sold the World</b>\n“David wrote this at home and it was a very haunting track. We were very impressed by it and we all had a good, deep feeling about it. We weren't quite sure what he was talking about in the beginning, and he explained it to us. I thought it was an intriguing title. It was another one that didn't take very long, because, again, we’d rehearsed it and learned it back in Beckenham. The ending was David and Mick and I doing that whole choir with the three of us. I was the low voice and Mick is somewhere in the middle and David's doing the very high stuff. That took a bit of a long time, but it was just so much fun. Mick played a lot of subtle guitar work, and I made sure it was heard on the new mix.”<br />\n<b>The Supermen</b>\n“I remember the image for this. David said, ‘Think of a cyclops and he’s stomping with his big feet and shaking the ground and he's coming at you with his horn and his one eye in the middle.’ David often had images for the way the sound should be. He would give us visual images. We were channeling classical, like Wagner or Mahler. We wanted a big symphonic sound. It’s really quite impressive.”"

            "short": "“I did my best to make it better. I think David would approve.”",
            "standard": "Tony Visconti always listens to <i>Space Oddity</i>, the first album he produced for David Bowie, with trepidation. “I hear things,” he tells Apple Music. “Things that if I could’ve done them better, I would have done them better. The music is great, but the mixing was really bad. I was a novice—a decent musician, but not very good at running production.” That’s why remixing the album for its 50th anniversary was something of a catharsis. He sweated over the process in his New York studio, where a framed drawing of Bowie hangs over the spot where rock’s great chameleon would sit while the pair worked on his final albums, <i>The Next Day</i> and <i>Blackstar</i>. “I have this second chance to do something right about that album, and I’m terrified that I might do something wrong,” Visconti says. “So, during the mixes, I turned to that space quite a bit and I said, ‘Well, what do you think, David?’ Not that he answered me, but I just feel like he’s never really left us.” The duo’s bond was strong enough that Visconti can feel confident Bowie would approve of the job he’s done here. He’s excavated what he calls “hidden treasures”—notes, sounds, vocals—that had been buried in the original mix, and created a brighter, bolder <i>Space Oddity</i>. Here, he guides us through it, track by track.<br />\n<b>Space Oddity (2019 Mix)</b>\n“[In 1969] I couldn't see the wood for the trees. We had just had all these orbits around the Earth, something that was in the news every day. All I saw was David cashing in on that. I called it a cheap shot. Right to his face. We were brutally honest with each other. That's what made us good friends. The job that Gus Dudgeon [the engineer who stepped in to produce the track] did was fantastic. I tried to bow out after that. I said to David, ‘I suppose you’re going to stay with Gus.’ And he said, ‘No, I've got that out of the way. Now I can make the album that I want to make.’ I think I’ve made it sparkle and explode a bit more. I think the mix actually makes your body move. Like, you don't realize that the drummer and the bass player were really grooving—the kick drum was always buried in the original mix.”<br />\n<b>Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed (2019 Mix)</b>\n“[David] was in a good space when he wrote this. He wasn't afraid to be politically incorrect. And he would really go for the jugular. [On 1967’s <i>David Bowie</i>], he wanted to be in show business. He was thinking about himself at 40 or 50 years old—king of the musical theater. He told me that. I asked him, in recent years, ‘What would you have done if you weren't a rock star?’ He goes, ‘Oh, I’d do music hall. I'd be writing musicals.’ But on this album, he was speaking for his generation. He was 22 years old, and he was feeling it like the rest of us were feeling it. This was the first song we recorded for the album and it was quite messy, really loosey-goosey playing. I don't mind that, but it made the original mix harder to do because the levels were jumping and there are a few blatant errors. So I tightened up the arrangement and was able to control the dynamics a bit more. There's some brass at the end that was never really poking out much in the original mix but is there now. Everything that is here was [originally] intended to be present.”<br />\n<b>Letter to Hermione (2019 Mix)</b>\n“I just wanted to make it a bit more floaty, a bit more dreamy. It's a beautiful, beautiful song. She [Bowie’s former girlfriend Hermione Farthingale] is very proud of that song. He was crushed when they split up. I've never seen him be so crushed, with any other split-up or any other woman. Hermione was a big thing in his life. She actually helped him a lot, to have a little more self-esteem. And she was a good cheerleader for him.”<br />\n<b>Cygnet Committee (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This is almost 10 minutes long, and the other challenge [with remixing it] is, there aren't many instruments on it. It doesn't have brass or anything. It was an anthem of youth, of the time—about oppression and all kinds of obstacles, and not wanting to make the mistakes of your elders. Trying to build a better future. But it’s kind of a bleak message, put across in a bleak way. And he really cracked up at the end. If my memory serves me well, he burst into tears after he sang that whole ending.”<br />\n<b>Janine (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This was a lot of fun to play, both in the studio and to play live. And I don't actually know who Janine is. You always have somebody in mind when you write a song. [Bowie once suggested it was someone his friend George Underwood was seeing at the time]. Yeah, there was a girl, yeah. I can't remember her name. Janine? I don't think so!”<br />\n<b>An Occasional Dream (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This is so beautiful. It's the epitome of his folk rock. A gentle, gentle song with a nice pokey little rhythm section behind it. Tim Renwick and I played the recorders. The recorder makes an appearance on almost every David Bowie album I produced—so it was a beginning of a thing between us. It was an eight-track recording, and we used to bounce things together because we knew we were going to run out of tracks. Both his lead vocals are on the same track, so it was almost impossible to do anything about that. But I was able to make a distinction between the two voices. I couldn't alter that track very much, but I made it sound pokier and more immediate.”<br />\n<b>Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud (2019 Mix)</b>\n“We only got one take, but we had the blessing of a three-hour rehearsal. David was the rhythm section. He sat right in the middle of the orchestra, with his 12-string, keeping the time. There's a little bleed of his 12-string, even though we had baffles around him to keep the sound out. He was <i>shaking</i> like a leaf at the beginning of the session. By the time the three hours was up, he was very calm about it, and it was a great take. I think Nigel Reeve of EMI told me David said this was his favorite song on the album. I can see why—it’s a masterful performance from him. I don't play piano, so I was writing all [the orchestra’s] parts, from my classical guitar—five sleepless days, just writing. The main thing to do was to get David's vocal in a better place. Get a nicer reverb on his voice. And get a little more depth out of the orchestra.”<br />\n<b>Conversation Piece (2019 Mix)</b>\n“This was really hard to leave off [the original vinyl]. That was a tragedy. We had three very long tracks—‘Cygnet Committee’ ate up the space of three songs—and on vinyl, you only had 20 minutes before you hit the out groove. If you went over the 20-minute mark, you would get one dB lower, for every minute over. This is a very, very sad song. Only years later, I realized that the person in the song who tells the story jumped off a bridge and drowned. That made me make a more sad mix. I was in a space like, ‘This has got to come off with a lot of gravity in the mix,’ even though it's kind of bouncy. There’s a way of mixing a bouncy song a little sadder. Not make it so bright. It’s one of my favorite, favorite songs. I loved playing it live.”<br />\n<b>God Knows I'm Good (2019 Mix)</b>\n“I made it sound a little more roomier. Like it’s in a bright large room, and with David's voice being intimate, but the guitars sound really crisp. Keith Christmas was the other lead guitarist. He played great, so he's featured more on this. It's one of my favorite tracks. The story [about an elderly woman caught shoplifting] is so sad. Oh my god. That's a real weeper, for me. It must have just touched a nerve with him, to even write it in the first place. He must have actually witnessed that.”<br />\n<b>Memory of a Free Festival (2019 Mix)</b>\n“We did this on the same day as ‘Cygnet Committee.’ The bass player was playing for so long, and so hard, his bridge kind of collapsed and almost every note was clicking and buzzing. So that was a job, to get that to sound decent on the remix. David's intro is still as beautiful as ever, with just him on the harmonium. He's underrated as a harmonium player. It's a live recording and he didn't make one mistake. When we did the backing vocals, I invited Marc Bolan to sing the ‘sun machine’ part. He's in there somewhere. You can hear him if you listen closely…I mean, really closely. We had everyone we knew, all our gang from the Three Tuns [pub] in Beckenham. Girlfriends, boyfriends, friends of friends, maybe 40 people in the studio. A few months later, we did it all over again when we did the single version. I really liked the single version a lot better—because by then, I knew what I was doing.”"

But underneath the pealing 12-string acoustic guitars and often lavish arrangements, the title track's chilling alienation and the doomy epic \"Cygnet Committee\" forecast Bowie's sometimes apocalyptic '70s lyrics. Elsewhere, the touching breakup ballad \"Letter to Hermione\" and the dreamily communal \"Memory of a Free Festival\" showcase a gentler side."

            "standard": "By the dawn of the 1970s, David Bowie had chased fame in so many different ways that he had to invent a fake rock star to become a real one. With 1972’s <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars</i>, he introduced the androgynous alien alter ego that confirmed glam rock’s status as the new Beatlemania, and granted Bowie the kingmaking powers to revive the careers of then-unsung heroes like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Mott the Hoople. Of course, the natural response to a blockbuster hit is to quickly crank out a sequel that delivers more of the same, and <i>Aladdin Sane</i> obliged—up to a point. Written primarily during his first major US tour in 1972 and released the following year, <i>Aladdin Sane</i> was conceived as “Ziggy goes to America”—a stranger-in-a-strange land travelogue that bottles up all the surging euphoria and creeping paranoia of the experience.\n\nThough it shot to No. 1 in the UK, and became his first album to crack the Top 20 in the US, <i>Aladdin Sane</i> occupies a peculiar place in the Bowie canon. It’s arguably more famous for its iconic cover image—an eternal source of inspiration for runway shows and Halloween costumes—than its contents. Aside from the jackboot stomper “The Jean Genie,” the songs on <i>Aladdin Sane</i> are largely excluded from classic-rock radio playlists and mythmaking compilations like <i>ChangesOneBowie</i>. (The fact that rollicking opener “Watch That Man” isn’t widely considered a glam standard on par with “Ziggy Stardust” and “Suffragette City” is a grave injustice.) But while it comes loaded with some of guitarist Mick Ronson’s toughest and heartiest riffs, <i>Aladdin Sane</i> displaces the wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am swagger of its predecessor with ominous portraits of social unrest (”Panic in Detroit”) and faded celebrity (“Cracked Actor”) that provide a looking-glass glimpse into this turbulent moment for Bowie and America at large.\n\nJust three months after <i>Aladdin Sane</i>’s release, Bowie famously staged his rock ’n’ roll suicide at London’s Hammersmith Odeon, announcing the demise of Ziggy Stardust and the Spider From Mars to the shock of thousands of weeping fans. But after hearing <i>Aladdin Sane</i>’s ghostly title track, they shouldn’t have been so surprised. Featuring an astonishing free-jazz piano solo from Mike Garson, the song clearly communicates Bowie’s desire to break free—not just from glam hysteria, but from rock ’n’ roll itself."

She also dives into her love of soul music, represented here on this exclusive Apple Music playlist curated by Lennox herself featuring the likes of TLC, The Staple Singers, Tina Turner, and Lauryn Hill. “Utter genius, you know?

Initially adopting and discarding musical styles almost at whim, Bowie became a global superstar during the glam era. Unlike many rockers, however, stardom increased his appetite for risk-taking. From Philly soul to Berlin experimentation to MTV domination to immersing himself in '90s electronic music, Bowie never lost his forward momentum.",
